# Prisma

This folder contains Prisma ORM configuration and database schema definitions.
The schema.prisma file defines database models, relationships, and migration settings.
Prisma generates type-safe database client code based on the schema for use throughout the application.
Run `npm run generate` after schema changes and `npm run migrate` to apply database migrations.
