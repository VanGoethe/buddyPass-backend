# Middleware

This folder contains Express middleware functions for request processing and validation.
Middleware handles cross-cutting concerns like authentication, error handling, logging, and request validation.
Each middleware function processes requests before they reach controllers or handles responses after.
Middleware is applied globally in app.ts or selectively in route definitions for specific endpoints.
