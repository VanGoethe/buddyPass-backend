# Routes

This folder contains Express router definitions that map HTTP endpoints to controllers.
Routes define the API structure, HTTP methods, and URL patterns for the application.
Each route file should group related endpoints and delegate request handling to appropriate controllers.
Routes are imported by the main app to establish the complete API routing structure.
