# Controllers

This folder contains Express route controllers that handle HTTP requests and responses.
Controllers receive requests from routes, interact with services for business logic, and return formatted responses.
Each controller should focus on request/response handling and delegate business logic to services.
Controllers are the entry point for API endpoints and should maintain clean separation from business logic.
