# Utils

This folder contains utility functions and helper modules used throughout the application.
Utils provide reusable functionality like data formatting, validation helpers, and common operations.
These modules should be pure functions without side effects and easily testable.
Utils are imported by services, controllers, and other modules to avoid code duplication and maintain consistency.
